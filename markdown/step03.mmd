2. Know the RSK address (0x...) and internet address of your Oracle (http://<IP>:5556).
3. Install Metamask in your browser.

###Structure of the Site
The site is divided into five tabs. In this guide we will use those tabs as reference.

###Tab Oracles
####Registration (Mint->Allow->Register)
To register your Oracle, you will need to allow the contract to use your MoCTokens. To do that, go to the Oracle tab and subtab Registration, and mint MoC Token (will be assigned to your account). After that allow part or the total of your MoCToken to the contract. For the last step, register your Oracle using the Oracle address, the network address and stake the total or part of what you allow, in the allow step.

####Edit your Oracle's configuration
At the end of the Oracle Tab you will see all of the Oracles and you will be allowed to edit or delete only your Oracles.

If you chose to edit your oracle, you can change the internet Address, the Stake and/or the subscription to the coin-pairs
![dapp](./guia03/GUIA08.png)

Coin Pairs - actions (Distribute & Switch Round)
At the Tab Oracle you can see the "Coin Pairs" interface, there you can switch round or Distribute.

The Distribute function will send SupportersWhitelisted's MocTokens to each Supporter.
